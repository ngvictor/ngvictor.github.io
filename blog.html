<h2>MDEI Bootcamp</h2>

			
<p>
	This was the first (unofficial) week of my new MDEI journey. Initially our intake of 2020 was suppose to start in person at the University of Waterloo in Fall but due to COVID, a lot of plans changed this year. Despite this, the faculty at MDEI continued on delivering high quality content  and teachings through the remote model which is highly commendable. Moreover, I appreciate the asynchronous lesson plans to accommodate the students from all over the world. 
<br><br>

	For myself, I'm currently working out of Vancouver Canada on the West so I missed out morning session. In addition, I'm still finishing my 2nd last week of my internship so things were a little hectic this week. 
	<br><br>
	The highlights for me this week was the interactive story telling module, where I got to meet a few of my classmates. What I was particularly impressed with was how coordinated everyone was and leveraged Teams to assemble into teams. (ironic right?) It was also refreshing to see everyone's Miro board which was also the first time I used the tool myself, I believe it would be one of the tools our class would take advantage of with this remote model. 
	<br><br>
	In a learning perspective, the usability testing modules refreshed my memory of what I had read about a while back. Since I had recently done usability testing during my internship, it was nice to put into words what I had experienced. 
	<br><br>
	Overall, it was a great start to MDEI and shout out to the class as well as the instructors for guiding us along the way. I look forward to what the program has to offer in the weeks to come.</p>
