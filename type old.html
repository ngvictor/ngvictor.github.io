			<h2>Design Opportunity</h2>

			<h3 class="minor">Communities of enthusiasts dispersed on multiple platforms
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are large communities of typography enthusiasts who are active online and who are constantly seeking out inspiration for their next design. They browse on traditional web based sites like TypeWolf, Google/Adobe fonts while a community of type enthusiasts resides on Reddit. On Reddit's typography community (/r/typography/, r/identifythisfont), people reach out to seek the source of a certain font or gain to feedback on a custom typeface they made.<br><br>
				<!--
			</p>
			<p>
-->
				<!--				Making the assumption that these enthusiasts work in cities and require a commute to work, school or just to get around. We decided to dive deeper into these communities of Type enthusiasts using their mobile device.<br><br>-->

			</p>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic" src="proj1img/Opportunity.png">
			<h4>Reddit communities: r/typography and r/identifythisfont where members outsource their font identification</h4>
			<p>

				While there are lots of different platforms to seek out typography inspirations for example Pinterest, Reddit, and FontsInUse; And font selection tools like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts. Users often have to <strong>switch from application to application</strong> throughout their workflow. There is <strong>not a single platform</strong> dedicated to streamlining a user's typography workflow from <strong>exploration to experimentation.</strong> Through a little background research we saw a demand for a tool that can make this happen.

			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p class="firstp">To help us gain a better understanding of the habits of a typography hobbyist to an expert typographer,  we conducted primary research using a survey with a series of multiple choice and short answer questions posted on Reddit.com. (Design and Typography subreddits) <strong>I made the questionnaire as well as distributing the survey</strong> as I am a frequent Reddit user.</p>

			<img class="imgwider" src="proj1img/Methodology.png">

			<p>We found that most of our survey respondents were young, as the results were restricted by the demographics of Reddit. <strong>We reinforced our findings by doing the survey through an interview format on faculty.</strong></p>

			<img class="imgwider topbottompic" src="proj1img/ResearchGrpahic.png">
		<a class="anchor" id="researchfindings"></a>

			<a class="anchor" id="findings"></a>

			<h2>Research Findings </h2>
			<p> Based on the data collected through our background research, we created two findings. </p>
			<h7>Finding 1: Existing comfort with image based mobile platforms</h7>
			<p>Our results indicate that <strong>younger respondents gravitate towards image-based online platforms</strong> such as Behance, Dribbble, Pinterest, Instagram to browse for inspiration and start their typography process while older respondents get inspiration from text-based content and experiences in real life. We also tested our assumption that a majority of our respondents browse for <strong>inspiration through their mobile device</strong> during their commute if they are not driving.</p>
			<img class="smallpic" src="proj1img/existingplatforms.png">

			<h7>Finding 2: Workflow usually ends at finding and selecting a font</h7>
			<p>Through further questions regarding the workflow, a majority of respondents <strong>felt extremely frustrated when they cannot find the font they are looking for.</strong> As a result, they have to settle for the second best option and some respondents even make their own font instead. </p>
			<div class="grid-row single">

				<h2>Persona & User Journey</h2>


				<p>Through these insights, we created the persona of Nina and created a journey map starting with her daily commute to work as a use-case scenario.</p>

			<h2>Guiding Design Principles </h2>
			<h7> 01  &mdash; Leverage Existing Experiences</h7>
			<p>We want to <strong>leverage users existing mental models of applications they already use.</strong> This lowers their cognitive load while using a completely new application. A list of current applications and tools typography enthusiasts use is made to help us design a familiar interface.</p>
			<h7> 02  &mdash;  Flows not Silos </h7>
			<p> <strong> Features should not live in silos</strong>, instead, every feature should be designed with cohesion and be mindful of the users end to end workflow. </p>
			<h7> 03  &mdash;  Flexibility</h7>
			<p> New typographers can learn and build on their skill while expert enthusiasts can use more functionality. All levels of expertise in typography are welcome.</p>
		</div>
			<a class="anchor" id="sketch"></a>

		<div class="grid-row single">
			<h2>Sketch & Wireframes</h2>
			<p> We began by sketching out the landscape of the application and features which were used in the users current workflow. <strong>I lead the design strategy and communicated Type's vision to the sketches and wireframes.</strong> On the left is a diagram of our anticipated brainstormed features.  </p>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic" src="proj1img/Sketch.png">
						<p> After our whiteboard session, <strong>we ended up with 4 main features that align with our guiding principles.</strong> Over the span of 4 days, we started making graybox wireframes for these features:   </p>

			<h7>
				<div class="title"><small>Feature 1:</small>
					<h7>Feed</h7>
				</div>
			</h7>

			<img class="imgwider topbottompic caption" src="proj1img/catalogwireframe.png">
			<p>Area for education and inspiration; feed + article feature allows users to search for new articles about typography as well as how types live in the design</p>
			<p>
			<strong>My design decision here was to use existing image based platforms as inspiration.</strong> Type users would know the interactions and UI flows based on their experience. The feed was inspired by Behance and Pinterest while the articles were inspired by Medium though all of Types content is related to typography. 
			</p>
			<h7>
				<div class="title"><small>Feature 2:</small>
					<h7>Catalog and Camera</h7>
				</div>
			</h7>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic caption" src="proj1img/catalogwireframe2.png">
			<p>The catalog feature helps users to identify fonts by uploading a design, or by taking a photo. In addition to font identification, the catalog is a repository of fonts in the app.</p>
<p> Design decision: I used Adobe fonts and Google fonts as my base knowing all my users have used at least one of those applications in the past. I applied my principle of flexibility to display information like a type bio and popular pairings to beginner users. The options start out as all closed as I knew different users have different workflows, I want the user to access what they want without having to scroll through. </p>
			<h7>
				<div class="title"><small>Feature 3:</small>
					<h7>Prototype</h7>
				</div>
			</h7>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic caption" src="proj1img/prototypewireframe.png">
			<p>Enthusiasts who want to test out what their fonts look like could use the prototype feature to quickly see their pairings and fonts in different scenarios. </p>
			<p> The prototype feature was a <strong>challenge</strong> to design as it displays the most complexity in features. To begin, I understood and researched the users workflow, some of the things they tested were font pairings, colors, and text details.(ex.size, kerning, spacing) I wanted the prototype feature to have <strong>as little as possible while still achieving their prototyping goals.</strong> Design Inspiration: Google Snapseed, mobile drawing applications</p>
			<h7>
				<div class="title"><small>Feature 4:</small>
					<h7>Profile</h7>
				</div>
			</h7>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic caption" src="proj1img/profilewireframe.png">

			<p>People can create an inspiration board to save fonts, articles, prototypes and font in use pictures in the app. It allows for private folders for work sensitive projects.</p>
						<p>To move from feature to feature, we allow users to save content and add it to a folder for a later time. Design Inspiration: Instagram, Google Drive, Dropbox</p>

		</div>
		
		<a class="anchor" id="design"></a>
		<div class="grid-row sidebyside">
			<h2>Design and Prototype</h2>
			<p>After a week sprint on brainstorming and graybox wireframing the proposed application, we presented it with some feedback for our next design phase. Initially, we had the camera(scan) feature in the catalog, through feedback from an industry critique, we decided that it would live as its own feature.
			</p>
			<p>In the design phase, <strong>I shared the responsibility of designing the interface with a teammate</strong>. Additionally, <strong> I performed quality checks of the screens throughout the design process.</strong> I assessed the interface to see whether it <strong>aligns with our design and project goals. </strong> </p>
			
			<p>When the screens were completed,<strong> I was responsible for making all the prototypes and interactions. </strong> </p>
			
			<p> <a href="typefeatures.html" target="_blank">Here is a link </a> to the solution and to the prototypes I created.</p>
			
						<img class="proto" src="proj1img/gifs/SCAN.gif" alt="Scan-img">

			<h4>Camera (Scan) and the Catalog feature.</h4>

				<div class="grid-row sidebyside">

					<h2>Notable screens - Prototype Feature</h2>
					<p></p>
					<img class="proto" src="proj1img/gifs/PROTO1.gif" alt="Scan-img">
					<p>This an interaction of enlarging the font size in the prototype feature. In the menu, I chose to hide the expandable menu due to the limited screen size. Text details for example kerning, leading and alignment are displayed one at a time and controlled through a swipe or selection on the text button. The reason for this design was to not overload the user with information.  </p>
					<img class="proto" src="proj1img/gifs/PROTO2.gif" alt="Scan-img">
					<p>
					By understanding the users typography testing habits, I am able to design a template feature where users can drag out dummy text to see what the font looks like. This saves users time when they want to compare fonts. 
					</p>

		</div>
			<a class="anchor" id="usertesting"></a>

		<div class="grid-row single">
			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<h7>To validate whether these features support our goals,<br>8 in-person user tests were done with:</h7>
			<img class="smallpic topbottompic" src="proj1img/UserText.png">

			<p> For the user tests I brainstormed what functions and sequence of tasks to test. The validation of our core layout and its similarities with existing image based applications was important. The <strong>testing tasks were designed for the audience to flow from feature to feature in order to see if they understood the application architecture.</strong> </p>
			<h7>General Test Outcome</h7>

			<p> The testers <strong>appreciated how the app focuses on typography</strong>. Through observation of how the testers completed the required tasks, I could see that there <strong>wasn't a lot of struggle while navigating through multiple features</strong>. This is probably due to the close resemblance with inspiration application.</p>
			<img class="smallpic topbottompic caption" src="proj1img/testingoutcome1.png">

			<p>Participants found that the flow from browsing through the feed to looking at the font in the catalog is a convenient resource in their typography workflow. Additionally, our participants expressed that since typography inspirations can come at any time of the day, the <strong>mobility of our application helps to streamline the steps of discovery to rapid prototyping.</strong> During the test, <strong>the prototype feature was not tested </strong>but it was explained and a demo was shown <strong>due to the limitations of a prototype.</strong></p>
			<br>

			<h8>“I like how on every picture, it shows which font it was created with and I could investigate more on that specific font… ”</h8>

			<h7>Testing Friction</h7>
			<p> 3 out of 8 participants found that the filter buttons on the Catalog were <strong>too small and confusing.</strong> Additionally, font inclusion in the saved project does not sit well with the rest of the content. 3 testers found that inconsistent vocabulary hindered them from exploring the app to its fullest extent. </p>

			<h2>Iterations from User Testing</h2>

			<span class="space"><small>3.0</small>&nbsp;REFLECTION</span>
		</div>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			
			<p>
				Type is an application filled with features. At the time of inception, our team concluded that each feature (scan, feed, catalog, prototype, profile) would benefit the user each in its own way and as a whole. Though that statement holds true, building the application with ample features ,in reality, would <strong>not be feasible in a small software development team.</strong> Thinking in the shoes of a product manager, <strong>I would build the main features while leaving secondary features on the backlog until a further time. </strong>
			</p>
			<h2>Feasibility of the Prototype Feature</h2>
				<img class="proto" src="proj1img/gifs/PROTO1.gif" alt="Scan-img">
<p>
				Due to the constraints of the prototype during user testing, the prototype feature could not be properly tested. Through further reflection, <strong>I personally would fully remove the prototype feature </strong>from the current application.
</p>
				<ul>
					<p>Reasons being:</p>
					<li>It <strong>could not be properly tested </strong>by users</li>
					<li>The prototype is a <strong>difficult feature to develop </strong>as it requires a different set of technical expertise </li>
					<li>The feature could be a <strong>standalone application by itself</strong></li>
					<li>The suggested font pairing feature in the catalog would suffice</li>
					<li>I assume users would <strong>rather prototype on their computers</strong> rather than on a mobile device (assumption needs to be tested) </li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Lastly, if the opportunity for future development presents itself, <strong>I would like to explore the onboarding process to minimize user frustrations.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Fin. Thanks for making it this far :) I welcome you to check out all the features and prototypes I made on <a href="typefeatures.html" target="_blank">this page.</a> </p>
