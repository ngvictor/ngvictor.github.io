			<div class="context2">
				<b>Overview</b>
				<br>During the time I was making my career switch and moved back home to Vancouver, I was feeling left out when my friends had gatherings in Toronto. I wanted to connect with them during their gatherings while I was physically away, Spotify being our app of choice, I realized it would be a great form of connection if I could listen in on their playlist live.
				<br><br>
				The whole project was done over the span of 10 days.

			<h2>Opportunity</h2>

			<h3 class="minor">Why do people listen to Spotify?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The intent of playlists are to hold a collection of songs specific to a users taste and preference. Custom playlists whether they are made by Spotify or an individual user, is Spotify's most popular feature today. </p>

			<p> There could be many reasons why people listen to music for example, one listens to Spotify to entertain, find joy, learn, lower stress and even to fall asleep.
			</p>
			<h8>"Music is an inherently social experience. Music physically touches us through its vibrations, and when people listen to the same songs and are literally moved by it at the same time, it creates a sense of togetherness we’re too often deprived of on the internet." - TechCrunch</h8>

			<p>Introducing a Live Playlist feature would bring people together through music in a wide variety of use cases. Currently, Spotify does not have any live features on the desktop or mobile application.</p>

			<p>The demand for live capabilities through music could be measured from relatively distant products like live streaming. Moreover, YouTube has many channels of live streaming music with thousands of listeners.</p>

			<h4>There are plenty of use cases for Live Playlists. For example, listening with co-workers at work through different headphones or a workout partner at the gym. It syncs to the same timestamp of the playlist.</h4>

			<h2>Application Dissection</h2>
			<p class="firstp">I started with a <strong>dissection of the application and interface to get a deeper understanding of the flows and the current design of the interface.</strong> </p>

<p>
				Media players have existed for a long time. I do not want to change anything significant to the existing application as users are used to the layout of a media player.
			</p>
			<p>
				After dissecting Spotify's interface. I interviewed 3 users all through the Spotify IOS app and made them do an application walk through as I had the newest version of the app at the time. Research on forums for overall sentiment of the application.

			<h2>Personas</h2>


			<p><strong>I decided to create 3 personas related to the 3 main stakeholders </strong>of Spotify, each with their own motivations and goals. These stakeholders include a Premium paying user, a free user and Spotify's company as a stakeholder. </p>

				Playlist Owner

			<p> I began by directly designing on the existing screens seeing where I can implement the Live Playlist feature. </p>

			<h7>
				Playlist Listener
			</h7>
			<p>There are two permutations of each screen meaning one could see a different set of interface elements depending on if they own or have permissions of the live playlist.  </p>

				<span class="space"><small></small>&nbsp;REFLECTION</span>
			</div>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>
				Live Playlist could enhance the experience of Spotify through making music a social experience like it should be.</p>
			<p>
				After I finished this project, I presented it to some friends. As feedback, a long distance couple could see an interesting use case of this feature. The couple could connect while performing separate activities in their own lives. The live playlist feature explores <strong>new ways with which people could connect with non verbal communication, and could add another depth in how people consume audio media.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			If I were to move forward with this project, I wont perform more research on Spotify user's listening habits and interaction habits. I would also conduct usability testing on the live playlist screens for the playlist owner and listener. Lastly, since the feature will be used in real time to add songs to the playlist, I would try to <strong>explore different interactions and user flows to quickly add songs </strong>instead of clicking through the options.
