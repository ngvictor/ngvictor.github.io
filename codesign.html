					<h7>Inspiration</h7>
					<br>
				This project was inspired by Melissa’s work in developing co-designed evidence-based public health interventions. She saw that there was a need for community based initiatives and a major implementation barrier was the lack of connection between communities, designers, and researchers.
					
<!--					guided by the principle of “Nothing about us, without us.” -->
				</p>

				<p>A partnership was formed to explore this topic. </p>

<h2>The Problem & Initial Frame</h2>
<!--
			<h3>
				"Co-design is an approach that builds and deepens equal collaboration between citizens affected by, or attempting to, resolve a particular challenge. A key principle of co-design is that users, as 'experts' of their own experience, become central to the design process." <br>- Design For EU</h3>
-->
<!--
We found that
				co-design is a relatively new theory in designing health-related interventions. While it has been around in participatory design in technology products, it has only recently begun to gain traction in healthcare with the move towards patient-centered care. More emphasis has been placed on the creation of community based initiatives for the health of the population. However, there are limited projects doing this currently.

<p>
				More emphasis has been placed on the creation of community based initiatives for the health of the population. However, there are <strong>limited projects</strong> doing this. </p>
			<p>
				Currently, work in creating community-based interventions is <strong>siloed</strong>. There are many instances where researchers and designers work separately, towards the same cause, with limited communication and sharing of resources. 
<!--				In addition, there are many practical challenges in representing the community voice and community goals. -->
				
				The current projects that exist using co-design principles are <strong>government funded</strong> and occur over long periods of time, however not all communities have <strong>access to these resources</strong>.

				<h2>What Is "Co-design" In Healthcare?</h2>

			<!--
			<p>
Co-design has also become increasingly popular in the service design field, where designers are involved with the process of the design, management, delivery and evaluation of public services. </p>
-->
<!--			<p> After being inpsired by this topic, we first started with a deep dive of the concept of co-design, we wanted to explore not only the concept but the history of projects within the field of healthcare and community health.</p>-->
			<p>Co-design (or participatory design) is an approach that emphasizes on the involving stakeholders to the design process to ensure the solution meets their needs. 
</p>
			<p> Co-design has recently begun to gain traction in healthcare with the move towards patient-centered care. This involves adding external researchers and designers to their creation process. </p>

								We decided to create, myCo-Design,
					a web application that connects communities (ex.

			<h2> Literature & User - Research </h2>
			
			<p> Health related projects are rigourous in their research. We started with a literature scan to see the benefits of co-design in improving health outcomes. 
				
<!--				We decided to do a literature scan of our own to see if the idea of co-design is worth pursuing and whether it has benefits to the sponsoring entity in community health.-->
			</p>
										<a class="anchor" id="findings"></a>

			<img class="smallpic topbottompic" src="proj2img/literature.png">
			<h3 class="sub">Literature Findings</h3>
			<p>Our findings were mostly related to <strong>acute care</strong> settings, for example in <strong>hospitals and clinics</strong>. Though there were consistent outcomes related to (a) the value of patient and staff involvement in co-design processes; (b) the generation of ideas for changes to processes, practices and clinical environments; and (c) tangible service changes and impacts on patient experiences. <small>Source: Open bmj</small> </p>

			<div class="narrow">
				<h7> Finding 1 &mdash; <b>Lack of Community based initiatives.</b>

				</h7>
				<p>We found that co-design has generally only been implemented in acute care settings, for example in hospitals. There is a <b>lack of co-design for community based initiatives altogether.</b></p>
			</div>


			<p>Being skeptical of only seeing positive successes of co-design, we decided to test the status quo.  A peer-review journal states that
				
				<strong>projects often do not correctly measure the outcomes</strong>. Moreover, as more health organizations are adopting co-design a rigorous evaluation of the outcome is needed.
			</p>
			<div class="narrow">
				<h7> Finding 2 &mdash; <b>Lack of Project Evaluation.</b>

				</h7>
				<p>There was not a lot of research on measuring the outcomes of a project. We agreed that it was important for us to design something that enable projects to be more results-oriented. </p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="sub">Guiding User Research Questions</h3>
			<p>Once we had a basis of knowledge about the area we were designing for, I began conducting user research to uncover the typical motivations and goals of each party in their project work process. I formed a few questions to guide us through the user research process:</p>
						<img class="smallpic topbottompic shadow" src="proj2img/guidingq.png">

<!--
			<div class="narrow threequestions">
				<h7>Q1 &mdash; How can each party measure their goals and outcomes at the end after implementation? Can their recommendation/design be further tested?</h7>
				<br><br>
				<h7>Q2 &mdash; How can we get each party engaged throughout the whole duration of the project? </h7>
				<br><br>
				<h7>Q3 &mdash; What a users main motivations and goals are while searching for a design/research personal project? </h7>

			</div>
-->
							<a class="anchor" id="user"></a>

			<h3 class="sub">Questions for Communities, Researchers and Designers</h3>
			<p> After making guiding user research questions, I conducted user research through <strong>interviews and surveys</strong>. I started with an interview at a <strong>local non-profit </strong>that focuses on supporting families, seniors, caregivers and children  to gain a deep understanding of the program creation process/model, grant funding process and normal day to day operations. </p> 
			
			<p>Insights from the community interviews were used to create two online surveys posted on Reddit and Facebook. One survey was <strong>targeted designers and the other targeted researchers</strong>. These surveys were posted on design related subreddits and science & academic subreddits/groups respectively to our targeted groups.</p>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic shadow" src="proj2img/research.png">
			<h3 class="sub">User Research Insights</h3>
			<p> I then gathered and formulated insights from our user research regarding each group:</p>
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic shadow" src="proj2img/Communityinsight.png">
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic shadow" src="proj2img/designerinsight.png">
			<img class="imgwider topbottompic shadow" src="proj2img/researcherinsight.png">

						<a class="anchor" id="target"></a>

			<h2>Understanding motivatons of each group</h2>
			<p>Through brainstorming after looking at our insights from our user research, <strong>creating an online platform </strong>emerged as a clear choice to achieve our goals to facilitate connection of communities to researchers and designers. Through an online platform, <strong>communities that are more rural</strong> or receive less funding could have <strong>equal access</strong>. The unique aspect of this platform is that it will emphasize and place the communities goals first. </p>
<p> We named the application myCo-Design as we wanted the team to take ownership of their own co-design project.</p>
			
			<h3 class="sub">Re-framing</h3>
			<p>
				In addition, our survey led us to targeting this platform to connect communities with students. Overall, we found that the  <strong>research and design student population</strong> is a valuable resource that is largely <strong>underutilized</strong>. Understanding that many communities may not have access to resources, students are often motivated to gain experience and contribute to research and personal projects that impact their community. By understanding each parties motivations, myCo-Design can be used to create projects rooted in research and design, while gaining experience for their research/design project. <b>Achieving a win-win-win situation for both the community sponsor, design student, and research student. </b>

		<h2>Design requirements</h2>
<p>I continued with some design requirements using our user research for our proposed application:</p>

<div class="grid-row single">
			<h2>Listing the tasks of each party</h2>
			<p>
				Knowing our application direction, I started to ideate on a list of data & requirements on the platform. I then made a rough sketch of the application flows and what is required for each step in order to journey map a proposed system.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<h3 class="sub">Working with urgency</h3>

<p>Since this was a personal project, there were no deadlines for tasks during my design process. For that reason, I set hard deadlines for myself to make sure everything was done in a timely fashion. It was challenging to perform this many steps in the design process within the three week timeframe. For example, I only had three days to interview each set of users plus survey designers and researchers. Working in urgency was deemed extremely useful as I did not have time to overthink, the show must go on. </p>

						<h3 class="sub">Navigating through the unknown</h3>

			<p>
			As a design student with a business background, I did not have known of the science and research community as well as the non-profit community. Instead, I reached out to my network to ask if they would be interested in speaking with me about their research process. In addition, I interviewed the Director at the non-profit I interned at 5 years ago. Special thanks to Tracy!
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="sub">Scoping down</h3>
			<p>
			Initially, we wanted the product to target specifically healthcare. We decided to pivot and aim at community health instead as the implications and scope of designing for healthcare is not feasible in this timeframe. For example, there are many legal implications while designing for a hospital and the level of expertise from researchers and designers would have to be much higher.
